# Final-Year-Project
This is my implementation of an image segmentation model (uNet + segNet) that automates object region delineation based on user input image into the web application developed with the Flask micro web framework.

Allow me to explain the files within the repository, the purposes they serve and the implementation techniques wherever necessary:
1. UNET.ipynb -> Google Colab Notebook used to train the uNet model, you may load the file to observe the training techniques implemented.
2. SegNet.ipynb -> Google Colab Notebook used to train the segNet model, you may load the file to observe the training techniques implemented.
3. .vscode, __pycache__, static, templates, app.py -> neccessary files to load into Visual Studio Code and execute the implementations of the web application
