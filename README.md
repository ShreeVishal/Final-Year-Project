# Final-Year-Project
This is my implementation of an image segmentation model (uNet + segNet) that automates object region delineation based on user input image into the web application developed with the Flask web framework.

Allow me to explain the files within the repository, the purposes they serve and the implementation techniques wherever necessary:
1. UNET.ipynb -> Google Colab Notebook used to train the uNet model.
2.
